\section{Module peach.sa.neighbor}

    \label{peach:sa:neighbor}

This module implements a general class to compute neighbors for continuous and
binary simulated annealing algorithms. The continuous neighbor functions return
an array with a neighbor of a given estimate; the binary neighbor functions
return a \texttt{bitarray} object.

Base class for continuous neighbor functions

This class should be derived to implement a function which computes the
neighbor of a given estimate. Every neighbor function should implement at
least two methods, defined below:
%
\begin{quote}
%
\begin{description}
\item[{\_\_init\_\_(self, %
\raisebox{1em}{\hypertarget{id2}{}}\hyperlink{id1}{\textbf{\color{red}*}}cnf, %
\raisebox{1em}{\hypertarget{id4}{}}\hyperlink{id3}{\textbf{\color{red}**}}kw)}] \leavevmode 
Initializes the object. There are no mandatory arguments, but any
parameters can be used here to configure the operator. For example, a
class can define a variance for randomly chose the neighbor -{}- this
should be defined here:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
\_\_init\_\_(self,~variance=1.0)
}
\end{quote}

A default value should always be offered, if possible.

\item[{\_\_call\_\_(self, x):}] \leavevmode 
The \texttt{\_\_call\_\_} interface should be programmed to actually compute the
value of the neighbor. This method should receive an estimate in \texttt{x}
and use whatever parameters from the instantiation to compute the new
estimate. It should return the new estimate.

\end{description}

\end{quote}

Please, note that the SA implementations relies on this behaviour: it will
pass an estimate to your \texttt{\_\_call\_\_} method and expects to received the
result back.

This class can be used also to transform a simple function in a neighbor
function. In this case, the outside function must compute in an appropriate
way the new estimate.

A simple neighborhood based on the change of a few bits.

This neighbor will be computed by randomly choosing a bit in the bitarray
representing the estimate and change a number of bits in the bitarray and
inverting their value.

          \item[nb]


The number of bits to be randomly choosen to be inverted in the
calculation of the neighbor. Be very careful while choosing this
parameter. While very large optimizations can benefit from a big
value here, it is not recommended that more than one bit per
variable is inverted at each step -{}- otherwise, the neighbor might
fall very far from the present estimate, which can make the
algorithm not work accordingly. This defaults to 2, that is, at each
step, only one bit will be inverted at most.
